# DESCRIPITION OF TASK LIKE HOW YOU PERFORMRD ND WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND PASTE PICTURES OF OUOTPUT :To visualize insights interactively, I created a dynamic dashboard using Power BI. The dataset was imported, cleaned, and modeled using Power BI's built-in tools. I developed multiple visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, slicers, and KPIs, allowing users to interactively explore the data. Key insights such as regional performance, sales growth, and category-wise comparisons were highlighted. The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly, providing actionable insights to stakeholders at a glance.
