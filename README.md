# DESCRIPITION OF TASK LIKE HOW YOU PERFORMED AND WHAT YOU HAVE DONE ND PASTE ICTURES OF OUTPUT: In this task, I built a supervised machine learning model to predict outcomes from a structured dataset. 
After initial data exploration, I performed feature selection using correlation heatmaps and domain understanding. 
I trained both classification and regression models depending on the problem type (e.g., predicting customer churn or house prices). 
Algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE. 
I split the data into training and testing sets and applied cross-validation to ensure generalizability. 
The final model was selected based on performance and interpretability, with results clearly explained in a well-structured notebook.
